			<p>  Imagine a world without violence!  Our mission at In Defense of Animals (IDA), an international animal rights organization, is to create a non-violent future for human and non-human animals, where both can live a more natural and harmonious existence.</p>
			<p>We envision a world where humans value all life, regardless of species.  A world devoid of slaughterhouses, factory farms, and puppy mills.  A world without poaching, and the exotic pet trade. A world where every creature has a home, and animal abuse is part of a history best forgotten. We envision a world where unarmed peacemaking replaces military intervention, where restorative justice replaces retribution, and where the economies of needs are based on simplicity and harmony for the natural environment.</p>
			<p>How do we plan to achieve this vision? We see human and non-human animals and the environment as vital parts of a whole.  Therefore, we approach animal activism from a holistic perspective--nourishing mind, body, and spirit.  We have the courage to face the dark places within ourselves, and we are not afraid to learn th lesson that beauty and trauman can teach.  Change for all animals, we believe, requires this paradigm shift--a profound psychological and spiritual awakening of self-awareness.  Without self-awareness, we will perpetuate a future filled with the same old problems.</P>
			<p>Human denial is the root cause of vast animal suffering.  At an early age, we intergrate this defense mechanism without awareness.  What is missing in the animal rights and welfare movement are trained activists who understand deniel, their own and other people's denial. Old tactics of frontal attacks no longer work.  We need strategic activists who know how to handle the mainstream denier, unaware of their role of complicity in animal suffering.  Sensitive to their guilt, we can work with their resistence--if we know how. IDA wants to help!  We must work with their resistance, not against it! Aggressive, guilt-ridden messaging are tactics that increase resistance, resulting in counterproductive relationships and less productive activism</p>
			<p>An activist must develop an effective voice--a voice of nonjudgment, empathy, and inclusivity--to successfully liberate animals. To mitigate animals suffering, human infighting and semantic squabbling must stop! We must learn how to regulate our emotions, unify fractions, and expand our membership. Helping activist to communicate effectively, IDA models values of integrity, trust, and compassion.  We see a world where killing animals has ended, and is not needed, and a world where conflict and violence are rare.  When either of these horrors does occur, they are address with creative energy and mindfulness.  As IDA blossome into a model organization--of compassionate collaboration, our membership (and the movement's) will grow in numbers. We can then all work together to challenge and replace the prevailing world view of innate human violence--with a higher image of human identity and animal sentience.  With a growing mainstream membership, our political power expands, strenthening our movement--and uniting millions of beings together.</p>
