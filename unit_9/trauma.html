			<p>Our society is suffering from long-term, unresolved effects of muli-generational trauma. We are emotionally numb, addicted to violence, alienated from each other and ourselves, and trapped in a vicious cycle of destructive behaviors.</p>
			<p>It is not just the animals that have been traumatized, but also activists. We seek to create a trauma-informed, animal-rights organization - one that is sensitive to traumatic events of animals, humans, and the earth.</p>
			<p>Trauma-informed means understanding how trauma impacts our inner world, other species, and the organizations and the cultures that we live in. Instead of denying trauma, avoiding it, or inviting it, we need to have a paradigm-shift in our relationship towards trauma.</p>
			<p>IDA's Animal Activist Helpline offers emotional wisdom by trained activists who help as mentors to create a core of agile activists. Through getting in touch with each one's traua, that is how we become agile and how we grow in optimism, joy, balance, and kindness towards one another. Being sensitive to our own trauma and to the trauma of others, agile activists can respond to fellow activists who are in pain, pre-vegans who are blinded still by denial of the mass suffering of animals and even to the slaughterhouse workers who are negatively impacted by the factory farming industry.</p>
			<p>Embracing our trauma helps to unify and expand our movement. It builds and animal-activist community with greater resiliency, more emotional intelligence, and heightened trauma awareness without denial or projection of anger.</p>
